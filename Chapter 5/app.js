var largeNum = 1000 * 2000;


// 4. Assign to a variable the value represented by one variable
// subtracted from the value represented by another variable

var result = variable1 - variable2;



// 5. Assign to a variable the remainder when one number is divided by

var remainder = number1 % number2;

// 6. Code an alert that displays the result of a multiplication on 2
// numbers.

var num1 = 2;
var num2 = 2;
var result = num1 * num2;
console.log(result);
